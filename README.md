-	Developed complex charts that showed the metrics generated by the AI about the products the user was interested in getting further information from. Each chart could read static data or dynamic ones like videos where each frame would have a specific set of metrics (same metrics across the platform), so the chart would change depending on the frame the user wanted to click and find out if the Product would require further refinement. The user was also able to have different sets of the same Product and be able to compare them with each other in a different section
-	Developed a Product Detail feature that included the Product of the user which could be static or dynamic, a chart with the associated data alongside all of the metrics of the Product are present including related Products of the current one and recommendations to the user made by the AI.
